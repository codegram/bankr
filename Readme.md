# bankr

Gather your bank account data through a nice ruby-esque API. Only supports
CaixaBank at the moment.

See `test_against_real_website.rb` as an example of how to use it.

## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
